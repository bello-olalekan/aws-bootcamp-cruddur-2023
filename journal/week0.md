# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework/Tasks

### Install and Verify AWS CLI 

I was not able to use Gitpod or Github Codespaces due to browser issues.
So I decided to use a local enviroment.

In order to prove that I am able to use the AWS CLI.
I am providing the instructions I used for my configuration of my local machine on windows.

I did the following steps to install AWS CLI.

I installed the AWS CLI for Windows 10 via command in **Command Prompt**:

I followed the instructions on the [AWS CLI Install Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

```
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```

I attempted to run the command by typing in `aws` but I recieved an error

```
C:\Users\Andrew>aws
'aws' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

I was able to resolve the error by closing command prompt, and opening it again.

### Create a Budget

I created my own Budget for $1 because I cannot afford any kind of spend.
I did not create a second Budget because I was concerned of budget spending going over the 2 budget free limit.
